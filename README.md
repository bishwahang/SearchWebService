================

This is a simple implementation of a Webservice that helps search the services from the UDDI registry.
It takes multiple argument separated by space, searches for the keyword and returns endpoints and description of the service.
The username and password should be changed in Authenticate.java file in src\SC13Project\Milestone2\SearchEngine\JuddiClient.
